Errors in Python
Review

Finding bugs is a huge part of a programmerâ€™s life. Donâ€™t be intimidated by them! In fact, errors in your code mean
youâ€™re trying to do something cool.

In this lesson, we have learned about the three types of Python errors:

    SyntaxError: Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language.
    NameError: Errors reported when the interpreter detects an object that is unknown.
    TypeError: Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.

There is also another type of error that doesnâ€™t have error messages that we will cover down the line:

    Logic errors: Errors found by the programmer when the program isnâ€™t doing what it is intending to do.

Remember, Google and Stack Overflow are a programmerâ€™s BFFs (best friends forever) in situations where an error is
giving you a lot of trouble. For some more motivation, check out this blog post.
